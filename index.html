 <p>Collaborations between art and fashion is something that has been present across the years.
   In the 1920s, Coco Chanel collaborated with the great Pablo Picasso to design backdrops for
   the Ballet Russes.
   Yves Saint Laurent returned to art often throughout his career, in 1965, he drew on bold
   abstractions of the painter Piet Mondrian so as to create a collection of six A-line dresses,
   later on in 1980 he created a couture collection after Henri Matisse's cut outs.
